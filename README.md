# MontrealNeighborhoodMap

This program is an interactive map that uses the Google Maps JS API to display markers on google maps,
and the Foursquare API to display information about the selected location. There is a sidebar on the
left side of the map where the user can filter the results they want to see, as well as select the 
title of the location they want to see, displaying the location's info above the marker. The locations
are selected from my favourite locations to visit in Montreal. 

# Requirements

To run, this app must be connected to the internet as well as have permission to access the Google Maps
and Foursquare APIs. 

# Running the Program

To run the program, simply clone the repository, and run NeighborhoodMap.html.
